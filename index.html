<h1>Hello Professor..</h1> 
<p style="font-size:160%;"> This is a site made by me. I made this in effort to show that for me art is most enjoyable when it is interactive. Even if that interaction is just scaning the QR code that got you here.</p>

<h1>About the Piece</h1> 
<br> 
<h2 style="text-align:center;">The Stars</h2>
<p style="font-size:110%;text-align:center;>">There is a great Greek myth to explain why these constellations are separated in the night sky. According to the myth, Orion was a great hunter and became quite boastful about his skills, claiming there to be no animal he could not kill. When Orion boasted to the Goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus, that he would kill every animal on earth, Gaia, the Goddess of the Earth, sent Scorpius to kill Orion.

A great battle ensued which saw the demise of Orion. The contest was however such a lively one that it caught the attention of Zeus, the god of the sky and ruler of all Olympian gods, who then honoured Scorpius by raising it to the heavens. The Goddess Artemis, who was Orion’s admirer, requested that Orion be honored in the same way. Zeus obliged, placing them on opposite ends of the night sky; Scorpio can still be seen today, endlessly chasing Orion across the night sky. This myth serves as a reminder to mortal men to avoid arrogance and boastfulness and to care for all creatures, large and small.</p>

<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center">The Ute Mountain</h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;">The Ute Mountain serves as the center of the universe for the Native American Ute tribe. It is also a source of protection. long ago it is told that a great mighty warrior defended the Ute tribe from all others it was warring against. But the warrior was too badly injured and laid down to heal and to rest. in time the dust blew over him turning to rock, soil came next, and finally the grass and trees. From the tips of his toes to the top of his feathered headdress this powerful warrior represents the Ute culture of days past and hopefully future. I have drawn it on this piece because it is part of my home. I spent years on the Native American reservation playing basketball with other kids at the foot of the Ute. I saw him every day I lived in Cortez for 21 years. he is on this paper because he and I have in common that we just want to protect people. the fact that he looks super cool is just good luck.      </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Feather</h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;">The Feather is a bridge from the Ute mountain and the Native American culture I was raised around 2 the technology that I use in my daily life now. The feather also serves as a token or reminder of my personality. I’ naturally flighty person and even when I am my most comfortable which is around other people I float like a feather group to group. The feather also represents my greatest fear and greatest desire I am deathly afraid of falling from great heights, and all I want to do is be able to fly.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The QR Code </h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center">The QR code serves as a statement piece. It is both how you got to here, and a symbol of the incorporation of technology and creative artwork that I find myself leaning into. It was also a monster to draw. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Circuit Board</h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;">The Circuit Board Has more meaning than you would think. There is the obvious technological theme present here, and while that is true it's real purpose is personal. My my logical father was absent for most of my life, when I was a young kid give me a Christmas present. it was this wooden box with hinges and a lid. Inside of this box were circuits that he had attached to the edges of the box and it was like really cool toy chest that I could carry around that my father had given me. The reason it's coming up here is because for many years he was not a part of my life he was the small chip in the bottom right corner. But over the two years his presence has grown in my life and spread much like the circuits do in weird and unpredictable ways. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Storming "R"</h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;">The Storming “R” is a take on the metrological sign for a thunderstorm. As I mentioned above, I played a lot of Basketball and so did my family. As the Rainers people would shout stuff at us like “bring the rain!” or remark that we move “like lightning”. But the deeper meaning and the cause for my adoption of it was that I myself was legally adopted into the family. So I adapted this as my symbol for anything I would sign, especially art pieces. With the intent to honor the family that gave me so much and allowed me to be where I am in life.</p>
