<h1>Hello Professor..</h1> 
<p> This is a site made by me. I made this in effort to show that for me art is most enjoyable when it is interactive. Even if that interaction is just scaning the QR code that got you here.</p>
<p>Below is the story of Orion the Hunter and Scorpio a.k.a. the one that taught him the lesson of humility at the cost of his life.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There is a great Greek myth to explain why these constellations are separated in the night sky. According to the myth, Orion was a great hunter and became quite boastful about his skills, claiming there to be no animal he could not kill. When Orion boasted to the Goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus, that he would kill every animal on earth, Gaia, the Goddess of the Earth, sent Scorpius to kill Orion.

A great battle ensued which saw the demise of Orion. The contest was however such a lively one that it caught the attention of Zeus, the god of the sky and ruler of all Olympian gods, who then honoured Scorpius by raising it to the heavens. The Goddess Artemis, who was Orionâ€™s admirer, requested that Orion be honored in the same way. Zeus obliged, placing them on opposite ends of the night sky; Scorpio can still be seen today, endlessly chasing Orion across the night sky. This myth serves as a reminder to mortal men to avoid arrogance and boastfulness and to care for all creatures, large and small.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The reason I like this myth and prioritize this is because I always have been a caring human. As a baby (before the age of 12) I was wildly passionate about animals and eventually this passion turned towards people and making them laugh.</p>
<p>As I grew as into my own person I started developing my need to make people laugh!</p>
